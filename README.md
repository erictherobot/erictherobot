# ERIC DAVID SMITH

> Building things every day. I am self taught. This means I am continually learning and making new mistakes every day. I'm grateful and proud of this mindset. This mindset has made me more of a generalist rather than a specialist.

### (NATIVE MOBILE - IOS) 

Unfortunately, several of my IOS apps were recently removed from the app store due to lack of updates. Seriously Apple? Thanks for supporting the little indie devs. The apps worked, nothing needed to be updated. Your notification emails went to spam. Some of my first apps are still in the store. Without updates... with even older code. SMH.
